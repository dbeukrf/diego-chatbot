# Project Brief: Personal Portfolio Chatbot

---

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:**  
An AI-powered portfolio chatbot that answers questions about the developer using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on personal documents, featuring a distinctive terminal-style interface and authentic personality.

**Primary Problem Being Solved:**  
Traditional portfolio websites are static and don't engage visitors. Recruiters and potential collaborators can't easily explore a developer's background, skills, and experiences in a conversational, interactive way. This chatbot transforms a portfolio from a passive resume into an engaging, explorable conversation.

**Target Market:**  
- Primary: Recruiters, hiring managers, and technical leads evaluating the developer
- Secondary: Fellow developers, potential collaborators, and professional network connections

**Key Value Proposition:**  
An interactive, memorable portfolio experience that demonstrates both technical capability (AI/RAG implementation) and personality (witty, helpful, enthusiastic), while providing comprehensive information about the developer through natural conversation backed by authentic personal documents.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

**For Visitors:**
- Static portfolios require manual navigation through multiple pages
- Finding specific information (skills, projects, experience) is time-consuming
- No way to ask contextual or follow-up questions
- Limited sense of the developer's personality and communication style

**For the Developer:**
- Portfolio doesn't showcase AI/ML capabilities in action
- Difficult to stand out among thousands of similar portfolio websites
- Can't capture visitor engagement or common questions
- Static content quickly becomes outdated

### Impact of the Problem

- **Time Cost:** Recruiters spend 6-8 seconds on average reviewing portfolios before moving on
- **Missed Opportunities:** Interesting projects or skills get overlooked due to poor discoverability
- **Commoditization:** Generic portfolio templates make differentiation nearly impossible
- **Engagement Gap:** No mechanism to create memorable interactions with potential employers

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Traditional Portfolios:** Beautiful but passive, no interaction
- **Generic Chatbots:** Lack personal context and authentic voice
- **LinkedIn Profiles:** Limited customization and personality expression
- **Interactive Demos:** Often disconnected from actual portfolio content

### Urgency and Importance

**Why Now:**
- AI/ML skills are highly sought after but hard to demonstrate
- Conversational AI is mature enough for reliable implementation
- Open-source LLMs (Llama) make this feasible without API costs
- Terminal aesthetics are trending and resonate with technical audiences

**Strategic Importance:**
This project serves triple duty: portfolio piece, technical demonstration, and actual utility for visitors. It's both the product and the marketing.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

1. **Terminal-Style Web Interface:** Streamlit-based chat UI with dark theme, monospace font, and terminal aesthetics. Users can type messages and receive responses in a scrollable container with color-coded messages (user vs. bot).

   *Rationale:* Foundation of user experience; differentiating visual design that signals technical credibility.

2. **Llama LLM Integration:** Open-source Llama model (local or API) for natural language understanding and response generation.

   *Rationale:* Core intelligence layer; demonstrates AI/ML capability without external API dependencies.

3. **RAG Pipeline with FAISS:** PDF ingestion → text extraction → chunking (~1k chars) → embedding → FAISS vector database → similarity search for relevant context retrieval.

   *Rationale:* Enables personalized responses grounded in authentic documents; showcases understanding of modern AI architecture.

4. **Personality System Prompt:** Template-based personality definition (witty, helpful, enthusiastic) integrated into LLM prompts.

   *Rationale:* Differentiates from generic chatbots; creates memorable interactions that reflect authentic voice.

5. **Structured Response Format:** Responses include bullet point TL;DR followed by conversational storytelling expansion.

   *Rationale:* Optimizes for both quick scanners and deep explorers; demonstrates understanding of information hierarchy.

6. **Embedded Contextual Links:** Responses include hyperlinks to relevant projects, resume sections, and social profiles when contextually appropriate.

   *Rationale:* Drives portfolio objectives; provides clear paths from conversation to concrete artifacts.

7. **Inappropriate Question Filtering:** Basic content moderation to reject offensive, irrelevant, or inappropriate queries with personality-consistent error messages.

   *Rationale:* Protects brand and user experience; maintains professional boundaries.

### Out of Scope for MVP

1. **User Accounts & Authentication** - Adds complexity without immediate value; chatbot should work for anonymous visitors.

2. **Chat History Persistence** - Stateless sessions sufficient for MVP; users can restart conversations easily.

3. **Multi-Language Support** - Focus on English-speaking audience first; can expand later based on demand.

4. **Email Chat Summaries** - Nice-to-have feature that requires email service integration; defer to V2.

5. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Basic metrics sufficient initially; comprehensive analytics can be added once usage patterns emerge.

6. **Mobile App** - Web-responsive interface sufficient; native apps add significant development overhead.

7. **Voice Input/Output** - Text-based interaction is MVP; voice adds complexity and browser compatibility concerns.

8. **Multi-Turn Context Window >5 Messages** - Simple conversational context sufficient for MVP; advanced context tracking can improve in V2.

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. **Functional Completeness:** All 7 core features are implemented and working reliably

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- $0 for MVP (use free tiers and open-source tools)
- Willing to upgrade to paid hosting (~$10-20/month) if traffic justifies

**Timeline:**
- MVP target: 1-2 weeks (part-time development, ~20-30 hours total)
- Polish and launch: Additional 1 week
- Total to production: 3-4 weeks

**Resources:**
- Solo developer (no team)
- Evenings and weekends availability
- Existing hardware: Laptop capable of running Llama locally for testing

**Technical:**
- Must use open-source LLM (no OpenAI API costs)
- Must work on free hosting tier initially
- Cannot require users to install anything locally
- Must be maintainable by single developer

### Key Assumptions

1. **Llama models can run efficiently enough** on affordable hosting or local development for acceptable response times (<5s).

2. **Streamlit's limitations are acceptable** - No need for complex state management, real-time features, or advanced routing for MVP.

3. **Personal documents contain sufficient information** - Existing resume, project READMEs, and notes provide adequate content for RAG to generate useful responses.

4. **Target audience appreciates terminal aesthetics** - Technical recruiters and developers will view retro-terminal design as a positive differentiator, not outdated.

5. **Simple RAG implementation is sufficient** - Basic chunking and FAISS similarity search will provide relevant context without advanced techniques (re-ranking, hybrid search, etc.).

6. **Personality can be achieved through prompts** - System prompt instructions are adequate to maintain consistent witty/helpful/enthusiastic tone without fine-tuning.

7. **No real-time collaboration needed** - Single-user, stateless sessions are acceptable; no need for multi-user chat or history.

8. **Free hosting tier supports expected traffic** - Initial portfolio traffic (~50-200 visitors/month) fits within Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces free tier limits.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

1. **LLM Response Quality Risk:**
   - Description: Llama may generate irrelevant, hallucinated, or off-brand responses despite RAG context.
   - Impact: Damages portfolio brand, wastes visitor time, reduces engagement.
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with diverse queries; clear system prompts; fallback to "I don't have information about that" for low-confidence responses.

2. **Performance Risk:**
   - Description: Response times may exceed acceptable thresholds (>5s) on free hosting tier, especially under concurrent load.
   - Impact: Poor user experience, visitors abandon before seeing capabilities.
   - Mitigation: Implement semantic caching for common queries; optimize embedding model; consider upgrading hosting if traffic justifies; add "thinking" animation to set expectations.

3. **Content Gap Risk:**
   - Description: Personal documents may not cover important topics visitors want to explore.
   - Impact: Chatbot provides unsatisfying "I don't know" responses, reducing value.
   - Mitigation: Conduct beta testing to identify common questions; augment document collection; craft good fallback responses that guide users to covered topics.

4. **Inappropriate Query Risk:**
   - Description: Visitors may attempt to jailbreak, troll, or submit offensive content.
   - Impact: Bot generates inappropriate responses or crashes, damages professional brand.
   - Mitigation: Implement content filtering; test common jailbreak attempts; graceful error handling with personality-consistent boundaries.

5. **Technical Complexity Risk:**
   - Description: RAG + LLM + custom UI may be more complex than anticipated, delaying MVP.
   - Impact: Timeline extends beyond 3-4 weeks, motivation wanes, project stalls.
   - Mitigation: Use proven libraries (LangChain/LlamaIndex for RAG abstraction); follow tutorials; scope creep prevention; MVP-first mindset.

### Open Questions

1. **What's the optimal chunk size for personal documents?**
   - Consideration: Longer chunks (2k) provide more context but less precision; shorter chunks (500) are more precise but may lose context.
   - Decision needed: After initial testing with 1k baseline.

2. **Should the bot have different personalities for different question types?**
   - Consideration: Technical questions could be more formal, personal questions more casual.
   - Decision needed: During personality prompt crafting; probably start uniform for consistency.

3. **How to handle questions outside document scope gracefully?**
   - Consideration: Generic "I don't know" vs. suggesting related topics vs. general LLM knowledge.
   - Decision needed: Test user reactions to different approaches in beta.

4. **What's the right balance between automation and manual curation of responses?**
   - Consideration: Fully automated (RAG only) vs. pre-scripted responses for FAQs vs. hybrid.
   - Decision needed: Likely hybrid - RAG for most, pre-scripted for critical intro and common questions.

5. **Should responses cite sources (specific documents/sections)?**
   - Consideration: Transparency and trust-building vs. interrupting conversational flow.
   - Decision needed: Possibly as optional feature ("sources" command) rather than inline.

### Areas Needing Further Research

1. **Llama Model Selection:**
   - Research best Llama variant for conversational use (Llama 2 Chat vs. Llama 3 vs. fine-tuned variants)
   - Compare performance vs. quality tradeoffs
   - Investigate quantization options (4-bit, 8-bit) for inference speed

2. **Embedding Model Optimization:**
   - Compare sentence-transformers models for speed/quality balance
   - Test domain-specific embeddings if available
   - Investigate asymmetric embeddings (different for queries vs. documents)

3. **Streamlit Customization Limits:**
   - How extensively can Streamlit be styled for terminal aesthetics?
   - What are workarounds for Streamlit's auto-rerun behavior?
   - Best practices for managing session state in Streamlit

4. **Hosting Provider Comparison:**
   - Streamlit Cloud vs. Hugging Face Spaces vs. Render
   - Cold start times and warm-up strategies
   - Resource limits and scaling options on free tiers

5. **Analytics & Monitoring:**
   - Privacy-respecting analytics options (Plausible, Simple Analytics)
   - Error tracking for production issues (Sentry alternatives)
   - LLM response monitoring (cost, latency, quality metrics)
